<h1>The Chicago Cubs</h1>

<h2>History:</h2>
 
<p>The Cubs started in 1876 as the Chicago White Stockings and were also named the 
    Colts (1890-1897) and Orphans (1898-1902) before becoming the Cubs in 1903. They 
    also had an alleged curse hanging over their heads for more than 70 years. The 
    start of the curse came during the 1945 World Series when, during Game 4, Billy 
    Goat Tavern owner William Sianis put a curse on the Cubs after he and his pet 
    goat were forced to leave Wrigley Field. The Cubs lost the 1945 World Series and 
    didnâ€™t play in another World Series until they won it all in 2016.</p>
