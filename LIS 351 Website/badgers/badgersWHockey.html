<h1>University of Wisconsin - Madison Women's Ice Hockey</h1>

<h2>History:</h2>
 
<p>The Wisconsin Badgers women’s hockey team has achieved several historic milestones since their 
    first WCHA conference game on October 8, 1999, when they defeated the Bulldogs 8–1 before a 
    season-high crowd of 3,892 at the Kohl Center. In 2006, they became the first team outside 
    Minnesota to win the Women’s Frozen Four, defeating the Minnesota Golden Gophers 3–0. The 
    Badgers went on to break the NCAA women’s hockey attendance record three consecutive years, 
    culminating in a crowd of 12,402 on January 28, 2012. On November 6, 2016, Ann-Renée Desbiens 
    set a new NCAA record with her 44th career shutout, and on December 4, 2016, Sarah Nurse made 
    program history by scoring the first-ever hat trick against Minnesota in an 8–2 victory before 
    a sellout crowd at Labahn Arena.</p>
